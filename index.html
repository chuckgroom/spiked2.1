         <P>Spiked is a two-player arcade game of action, cunning,
         and skill. It was conceived, animated, and programmed by
         <A HREF="../index.html">Chuck Groom</A>
         (<A HREF="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;eg&#64;sccs.swarthmore.edu">e-mail</A>).
         This site distributes Spiked, provides information about
         game play, posts news about possible future development, and
         provides other programmers with some of my source code.</P>

         Spiked 2.0 has been revised and Spiked 2.1 has been
         released. This update fixes many of the bugs in Spiked 2.0
         and expands the Spiked game.</P>
         
         <P><STRONG>Bugs Fixed</STRONG></P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>Once in a while (about twice and hour) Spiked would
            freeze between matches.
            
            <LI>During a match, the game would just up and quit for
            no particular reason.
            
            <LI>If you didn't have a "Spiked Contstants" (now called
            "Spiked Physics") file, then the game would bug out.
         </UL>
         
         <P><STRONG>New Features</STRONG></P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>Spiked now works in 256, thousands, and millions of
            colors.
            
            <LI>Spiked features new background graphics for the
            prefs. and about screens. These screens are more clearly
            organized and let the user find information faster.
            
            <LI>There is a new weapon, the <B>Rockyspiker</B>, which
            turns a rock into a rockyspike and vice-versa.
            Rockyspikes are like spikes, except that they can be
            destroyed by spikes.
            
            <LI>The event processor is more optimized, so gives you
            snappier response times.
            
            <LI>You can now pause in the middle of a match.
            
            <LI>You can have multiples of the same item, e.g. five
            cannonballs, at once.
