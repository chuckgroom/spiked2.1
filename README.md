Spiked v2.1
=========

Spiked is a MacOS Classic 2-player arcade game which was released in 1997. 
It does not run on recent versions of MacOS X without significant contortions. 

I started writing Spiked when I was in high school, and finished it in 
college. Many years later, when I was cleaning up an old server, I found 
the source code in a corner gathering dust, and figured it would be
nice to post it before it got lost. Do not judge me on the code quality; 
it was half a lifetime ago. That being said, I'm fairly impressed that
the Past Me pulled this off. 

See the about.txt file for more information on gameplay. 

I had originally released Spiked as "freeware," not quite knowing that there
was a whole open-source thing going on. While I still want to stay true
to that intent, I've revised the license to be under the GPL-3.0; see
the gpl-3.0.txt file.
