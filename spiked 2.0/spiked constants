Fast computer can boost this up to 	1, to make the game go very, very quickly, or you can slow the game play by setting it to 	3, or even 4.5) How many ticks you pause after the end of a game to display the winner-loser screen6) How often, in frames, a rift will be created. This is the inverse probability (1/this = prob	that a rift will open up in a single frame7) The chance that a rift will deposit a rock, as opposed to a gift8) The optimal number of sprites on screen.9) The number of frames that a twister holds its victem in thrall10) The number of frames that a gravitron will affect its target11) The maximum velocity a player can achieve12) The natural -- optimal-- velocity a player will default to, left to his/her own devices.13) The player's mass. 10 is normal14) The mass of the bullet15) The mass of the cannonball weapon16-20) The relative probabilites that a given gift will materialize. Here's what these mean:	16) LIFE	17) CANNONBALL	18)	TWISTER	19) SPEED	20) GRAVITRON	#16 + #17 + #18 + #19 + #20 must equal 1 (sum of probabilites = 100%)
