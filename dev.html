While I could have written it using about half the code, I decided to make it as modular as possible so that I could re-use the code in the future. This will be a brief -- and by no means complete -- overview of the organization and flow of information through the program. <P>Ingemar Regnemalm's Sprite Animation Toolkit (SAT), a shareware developing tool, was used to handle the task of sprite management.. To do gamma fades (fading the screen to black) I used the GammaLib developed by Matt Slot. Finally, a lot of information about the Mac OS comes from Jim Trudeau's <I>Programming Starter Kit for Macintosh</I> (1995, Hayden Books).<HR>The program can be divided into three major components:<UL><LI> The Sprites: <DL><DD>The sprites are autonomous units that have their own behavior. They are the easiest part of the game to understand because they are what you see when you play the game.</DD></DL><LI> Game Management: <DL><DD>The game arenas that control the gross organization of the sprites and events that will trigger changes in the game.</DD></DL><LI> Event Management & The Big Controllers:  <DL><DD>The code to get mouse events, key-down events, menu processing, opening windows, etc, from the operating system and process these events for the game.</DD></DL></UL><HR><H3> SPRITES </H3> <P>Sprite animation is the Disney-style animation scheme in which you have a background, and animation cels you place over the background. By keeping the background constant and changing the cels, you achieve animation. A sprite is one of these animated objects. For this project, the backgrounds are 640x460 pixel pict resources (480 - 20 pixel menubar = 460), and the frames of animation are some 250 colored icon (cicn) resources. I drew/rendered all the images.<P>Ingemar Regnamalm wrote the Sprite Animation toolkit for doing the overlays of sprites on backgrounds. In his toolkit, you create sprite units, each with its associated tasks that are invoked each time the main animation call, <CODE>SATRun(TRUE)</CODE> is used. I don't like this style of programming because it is only quasi-object-oriented, so I gave it a major overhaul.I only use SAT's functions for setting up a window, grabbing a background, loading the sprite frames (analogous to the animation cels), creating sprites, and positioning sprites. All other sprite behavior is controlled by the sprite hierarchy.<P>What makes sprite animation so neat is that sprites are an autonomous units, and thus lend themselves to being set up in a class hierarchy. They make wonderful models for real-world objects because each sprite takes care of its own behavior as would a real object. For example, if you hit a player sprite, it deals with the collision and adjusts its velocity accordingly.  Spiked maintains a hierarchy of sprites and a list structure to keep track of all the instances of the sprites. <P>I thought the best way to organize sprites was in a hierarchy of abstraction, with the most abstract "sprite" at the top of the hierarchy, and the more specific objects derived from more abstract base classes. Since Spiked is a loop and event driven program, the way that sprites are managed is that at each iteration of the loop each sprite's <CODE>do_behavior()</CODE> function is called. Since this is a virtual function, the most derived class catches the <CODE>do_behavior()</CODE> function, does the behavior, and then calls its super-class's <CODE>do_behavior()</CODE> function. Thus, at each iteration of the loop, the <CODE>do_behavior()</CODE> function is called for every hierarchical level of every sprite. In this way, I could partition tasks to each segment of the hierarchy that would be performed at each iteration. <P>The header file <A HREF = "sprite.h">sprites.h</A> contains the following class definition of the sprite class, which is the super-class for all sprites:<P><PRE>class sprite{	private:		SpritePtr theSprite;		//The SAT handle to the sprite that appears on screen		int *myFaces;				//a list of all faces	protected:		int num_of_faces;			//the number of total faces available		int cur_face;				//the current face index		void load_faces (void); 	//determine which faces this sprite may use.		class sprite_manager * the_sprite_manager;	//The list 'o sprites	public:		sprite(fPoint, sprite_manager *);		~sprite();				//The mechanics of sprite behavior and existances:		SPRITE_TYPE myType;		//The kind of sprite		fPoint position;		//H and V coordinates of position		fPoint velocity;		//H and V components of velocity		float draw_radius;		//How many pixels in radius the sprite is		float collide_radius;	//How many pixels from the center counts as a "hit"		float mass;				//Units of mass		Boolean alive;			//Is the sprite alive? If this is ever false, the sprite is deleted		Boolean collideable;				int thrust_disable; 	//How many frames a player's thrust will be disabled				virtual void do_behavior(void);			Boolean circle_in_sprite(fPoint, int);		virtual Boolean collide(sprite *) {return FALSE;}		//default				//The virtual functions used in derived classes:		virtual void do_collision(sprite *) {;}		virtual void do_clicked(void) {;}		virtual void do_sprite_action(S_ACTION) {;}		virtual GIFT_TYPE read_gift(void) { return NO_GIFT;}	//default};</PRE>As you can see, this class keeps track of the SAT SpritePtr, the sprite's fundamental attributes, several virtual functions, and a lot of data. Each time that this class' <CODE>do_behavior()</CODE> function is invoked, it makes sure that the sprite is alive, sets the sprite's face to the correct cel, and positions the sprite correctly on the screen. <P>All sprites in Spiked are thought of as little circles, with a center position, a drawing radius, and a collision radius. They each have their own mass, position, and enumerated type. When a sprite in a derived class is constructed,  it sets its type, and loads its face resources into the myFaces array, which in turn is an index for a global array of face pointers maintained by the GData class. Every time that a sprite's do_behavior function is called, the sprite can perform its unique behavior. Also, notice the do_collision function. Whenever two sprites collide, this function is called on both sprites, with the other as the input. This lets sprites interact with one another appropriately.<P>Here's a diagram of the sprite hierarchy. The red classes represented by red boxes are sprite types that are actually created in the game. <BR><IMG SRC = "sprite_heir.GIF"><P>There are simply too many sprite types to describe. The main points that should be remembered, though, are that the <CODE>do_behavior()</CODE> function is called for each layer of the hierarchy of every sprite, every iteration, and that the abstract classes do most of the "house-cleaning" -- animation and movement -- while the derived classes tend to take on the duties of specific sprite behavior. Also, remember that while the sprite class moves sprites and chooses how they look, the work of animation -- all the OS calls -- is done by the SAT when I call <CODE>SATRun(TRUE)</CODE>.<P>Each sprite has its own .cpp file. If you want to read more about the specific implementation of sprites,<A HREF = "source.html">look at the project's source code</A>. Or, you can look at the header <A HREF = "sprite.h"> "sprite.h"</A> to get an idea about all the sprites and how they are related.<P>The data structure that holds all the sprites is the <A HREF = "sprite_manager.h">sprite_manager class.</A> It maintains an array of pointers to sprites. It is a simple stack-like structure that keeps track of the current top of the list. Whenever a sprite is dynamically allocated, a pointer to it should be passed to the sprite_manager class using either the <CODE>add_sprite(sprite *)</CODE> function or the <CODE>add_sprite_in_region(sprite *)</CODE> functions. What these two functions do is copy the pointer onto the top of the list and increment the counter keeping track of the top of the list. The difference between the two functions is that <CODE>add_sprite_in_region()</CODE> jiggles the new sprite around on screen until it is not within the collision boundaries of another sprite. <P>The sprite_manager is used to drive sprite behavior and collision detection. The call <CODE>run_behaviors()</CODE> causes the sprite_manager to iterate down its list of sprites, and invoke their <CODE>do_behavior()</CODE> functions and cull out dead sprites. <CODE>collision_check()</CODE>, an O(n^2) algorithm, checks if every sprite in the list has collided with every other sprite on the list. For each collision, both sprites involved have their <CODE>do_collide(sprite *)</CODE> function called, with the other sprite as the input. Finally, when the sprite manager is destroyed, it clears all the sprites from memory.<BR><A HREF = "sprite_manager.cp">Sprite manager .cp file</A>  || <A HREF = "sprite_manager.h">Sprite_manager header</A> || <A HREF = "source.html">Project source code</A><P><HR><A NAME = "arena"></A><H3> THE ARENA SYSTEM</H3><P>Conceptually, sprites make sense -- little units that flit about. The idea of an arena is slightly more abstract. Arena are the playgrounds for sprites. The arena is responsible for interfacing the autonomous sprites with the larger game at hand. They set the scene and the rules that sprites must play by. All arenas maintain a background (a pict resource) and catch events that are relevant to game flow. <P>The arena heirarchy is quite simple: the arena class is the base class, and it stores a sprite manager and access to an EventStack. The derived classes are: the game_arena, the pref_arena, the intro_arena, the about_arena, and the post_game_arena. Arenas follow the same basic pattern: when they are constructed, they change the background and add sprites to the background. Later, the main game loop sends a <CODE>run_frame()</CODE> call to the current arena each iteration. This is the main game loop, and the specific implementation differs for each arena.<P>Each time that the <CODE>run_frame()</CODE> function is called, the arena will pop all the events off the EventStack that have bearing on the arena’s function, and route these events correctly to affect sprite behavior. Then, the arena will call the sprite manager’s run_behaviors function to let the sprites do their behaviors. The game_arena also runs collision detection. Finally, the arena tells SAT to run the animation with <CODE>SATRun(TRUE)</CODE>.<P><A HREF = "arena.h">Header for all arenas</A> || <A HREF = "arena.cp">Arena and intro_arena class source</A> || <A HREF = "game_arena.cpp">game_arena source</A>  || <A HREF = "pref_arena.cp">pref_arena source</A> <P><HR><A NAME  ="macOS"></A><H3> THE MACINTOSH OS AND GAME CONTROL </H3>How does a mouse click get interpreted as a button being pressed? How does the game respond to five keys being down at once?  Spiked uses four chunklets of code to analyze these Macintosh System events, catch important events, and route the events to the appropriate place.<P>Spiked is event driven -- that is, there is an infinite loop that constantly checks to see if anything has happened that it should respond to. Spiked has its own data structure for dealing with internal events, a GameEvent class. This class hold the enumerated type of the event (such as a Gmouse_down event), where the mouse was on screen when the event occured, and a char that may hold data. The game maintains a stack of events, which is called the EventStack. The idea behind this system is that relevent Macintosh OS events are filtered into being GameEvents, and added to the top of the stack. Then, various parts of Spiked grab these events off the stack and deal with them appropriatly. (The GameEvent class and EventStack are described in <A HREF = "EventArbitrator.h"> "EventArbitrator.h" </A> and <A HREF = "EventArbitrator.cp">"EventArbitrator.cp"</A>.)<P>The main piece of event-management code is <A HREF = "OSEvent.cp">OSEvent.cp</A>. The OSEvent class is very powerful. Each iteration of the main game loop, the OSEvent's function <CODE>ProcessEvent(EventStack *) </CODE> is called. This function polls the OS for events, and then filters them. It either directly responds to high-level events itself, like window or menu events, or else it creates new GameEvents based on the Macintosh events, and pushes them onto the EventStack.<P>The Menu system is pretty much your standard Macintosh menu system. It is driven by OSEvent.cp. Nothing special here.<P>What is more interesting is the Keyboard Filter I wrote. Macintosh events include KeyDown and AutoKey events. One would think that these events would allow for an easy way to play an arcade game -- just grab the KeyDown event, and read its char. This works, provided that only one key is pressed on the keyboard. This is not the case in spiked -- at a given time, some people may be pressing something like 6 keys at once. To cope with this, I completly short-circuit the KeyDown events and use my Keyboard Filter, a KBDFilter class. This class uses the Macintosh's <CODE>GetKeys(...) </CODE> function which reads out the keyboard as four longs. This is cool becuase a "1" in a long means that the corresponding key is down. So, the OSEvent class asks the KBDFilter class if any keys are down with the <CODE>key_is_down()</CODE> function, and if so the OSEvent class calls the KBDFilter's <CODE>run_filter(Event_Stack *stack)</CODE> procedure. For each key that is down, another event is pushed onto the stack. <P>And now a small note about conversion: how do I know which bit placement in the longs corresponds with a char? I constructed a table of long-bit-place to char, and the KBDFilter reads this off disk ("Spiked.dat") when it is constructed. <P>Headers: <BR><A HREF ="KBDFilter.h">"KBDFilter.h"</A><BR><A HREF ="EventArbitrator.h">"EventArbitrator.h"</A><BR><A HREF ="Menus.h">"Menus.h"</A><BR><A HREF ="OSEvent.h">"Menus.h"</A><BR><P>Sources: <BR><A HREF ="KBDFilter.cp">"KBDFilter.cp"</A><BR><A HREF ="EventArbitrator.cp">"EventArbitrator.cp"</A><BR><A HREF ="Menus.cp">"Menus.cp"</A><BR><A HREF ="OSEvent.cp">"Menus.cp"</A><BR><P><HR Width = 50%>Spiked uses two classes to store its global data: the GData class, and the GTool class. The GData class holds the game prefs, several constants, and sprite face resource data. The GTool class holds information about machine state, and provides tools for fading the screen and changing the background. There are two global instances of GData and GTool: GlobalData and GlobalTool, respectively.<P>The <A HREF = "global.h"> global.h </A> header describes both these classes, and more. There are a few global constants and enumerations in Spiked, and they are are gathered in this header. They are appropriate data to make global constants, because they describe the fundamental structure of Spiked. (<A HREF = "global.h">global header</A> || <A HREF = "global.cp">globals source</A>)<P>I mentioned a the Spiked prefs. The preference class keeps track of which char corresponds to which  player's actions -- turn the red player left, for example. The prefs class matches an enumerated type representing these actions with the chars. When the prefs class is constructed, it reads this information off disk ("spiked.pref"). During the course of the game, the user may change these prefs (in the pref_arena), and when the game quits, as the prefs file is destructed it writes the information to disk. Whenever the game_arena loop catches a key event, it askes the prefs to interpret the key. The prefs class returns the enumerated type that the char corresponds to. (<A HREF = "prefs.h">prefs header</A> || <A HREF = "prefs.cpp">prefs source</A>)<P>Another side note: The fader class. An instance of the fader class occurs in the GTool. This class controls the GammaFad library's functions that let the user fade the screen to black. (<A HREF = "fades.h">fade header</A> || <A HREF = "Fades.cp">fade source</A>)<P><HR><A name = "big_loop"></A><H3> THE BIG LOOP</H3>The main class that drives the game is the (you guessed it!) GAME class. This class creates most of the data structures used in the game (the EventStack, the GData and GTool, the OSEvent handler, etc) when constructed. The <CODE>run()</CODE> call from <CODE>main()</CODE> tells the GAME class to enter a loop that can only be broken when the EventClass registers a Gquit event type. <P>The GAME class holds a pointer to an arena. This arena is first set to a new intro_arena. Whenever the EventStack receives a command for a new type of arena (the change arena events are Gpref_arena, Gintro_arena, Gplay_arena, Gabout_arena, Gpost_game_arena), it deletes the previous arena. This tells that arena to invoke its destructor, and clean out all sprites. Then, the game class dynamically creates a new arena of the desired type, and will feed this new arena all the <CODE>run_frame()</CODE> commands.
